abstract = {The purpose of this Note is to propose a time discretization of a partial differential evolution equation that allows for parallel implementations. The method, based on an Euler scheme, combines coarse resolutions and independent fine resolutions in time in the same spirit as standard spacial approximations. The resulting parallel implementation is done in the non standard time direction. Its main goal concerns real time problems, hence the proposed terminology of "parareal" algorithm. {\textcopyright} 2001 Acad{\'{e}}mie des sciences/{\'{E}}ditions scientifiques et m{\'{e}}dicales Elsevier SAS.},

  abstract = {Parallelization of partial differential equations (PDEs) by time decomposition has attracted much interest, mainly due to its potential to enable very long time simulations beyond what is possible using spatial domain decomposition. However, there has only been limited performance analysis of the parareal algorithm in the literature, ignoring the efficient scheduling of tasks. This paper presents a detailed study of the scheduling of tasks in the parareal algorithm that achieves significantly better efficiency than the usual algorithm. Two algorithms are proposed, one which uses a manager–worker paradigm with overlap of sequential and parallel phases, and a second that is completely distributed. Experiments were conducted with the 2D heat equation. It was found that the rate of convergence decreases as the number of processors increases, in the case of strong scaling (fixed time interval). However, for weak scaling results the rate of convergence was unaffected by the number of processors. The results of this paper suggest that the parareal algorithm is a promising approach to solving long time evolution problems, particularly when the goal is simulation of longer times using more processors. It also exhibits characteristics that make it particularly suitable for execution on heterogeneous computational grids, such as low communication overhead and easy accommodation of different processor and network speeds.}

abstract = {The parareal algorithm is used to obtain temporal parallelization added to the parallelism obtained from the conventional spatial domain decomposition techniques for hydrodynamic problems. Parareal solution becomes unstable at high Reynolds numbers where the non-linear convection term in the Navier–Stokes equations becomes much larger than the diffusion term. A new framework that allows using parareal for unsteady high Reynolds number hydrodynamic problems is proposed where parareal coarse and fine time integration operators are incorporated with coarse and fine spatial grids respectively and RANS or DES turbulence models are employed with a blended filter that can be tuned for the stability of the method. This framework is composed of three solution stages where parareal serves as a transitional stage that bridges a coarse grid solution to a fine grid one. While in lower Reynolds number problems parareal solution can serve as a final solution, in higher Reynolds number problems with high degree of non-linearity parareal provides a shorter path to the final solution. Anticipating a parareal stage in a transitional sense allows a looser convergence requirement which leads to high speedup gains in that stage. On the other hand improved initial values at the beginning of the last stage yields a shorter final fine stage solution. A windowing technique is employed in this methodology to further control the parareal instabilities by keeping the parareal corrections smaller while still being able to cover an arbitrary simulation time with given computational resources. Application of this methodology has been illustrated with a fully turbulent vortex shedding from a cylinder and a flow from the Grand Passage tidal zone in the Bay of Fundy. It is concluded that a tuned turbulence model may sufficiently stabilize the parareal methodology for many practical problems such that it becomes applicable in the initialization process if not accurate enough as a final solution. MPI and OpenMP programming paradigms are used for temporal parallelism introduced by parareal and data parallelism obtained via spatial domain decomposition methods respectively. Also all computational tasks are accelerated using CUDA compatible GPGPUs.}
